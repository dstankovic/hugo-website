### Tagline
I'm software engineer currently based in Berlin, Germany. I work for ESCRIBA where I rewrite their old Struts applications into new frameworks like Angular/React.



### Experience
After working in Gtech for 2 years on various projects, I decided to change my path and swtich from corporate to startup company. I've joined TruckTrack and help them build a modern SaaS solution for managing trucking companies. With my mission done there, I joined San Francisco based company Embroker as #4 engineer and seen company grow from barely 10 to 100 people. Meanwhile I decided to move to Berlin, since I wanted to join a bit bigger community and have a better base for traveling around. There I'm helping Escriba to rewrite their old legacy clients in a newer technologies. You can motivate me with a great and interesting projects but not money. You can check "let's work toghether" section for more details.
