title: About me
---

<br/>
I am software engineer based in Berlin, Germany. I work for Kayak as a member of performance marketing team. We usually code using Javascript and Java. 

<br/>
#### Experience
With over 8 years as a software engineer I worked in gambling, logistics, insurance, and travel industries. Some of the things I worked on is creating online draw games for Swiss, Belgian lottery, generating invoices and tax returns for truck drivers, 3rd party integration with Zenefits and SAP, crated a few cross-platform apps and give a try on game development. Few years ago I moved to Berlin where I'm moving mostly in corporate waters but always in the loop with local startup community. You can find a lot more on my [resume here](/public/dusan_stankovic_2020.pdf).

<br/>
#### What else I do
I like to teach people programming. I believe that in this new economy everyone can benefit from coding and in the future, it is going to be an everyday tool for any human. So far I held few javascript courses for unemployed in Serbia, NodeJS course for students in Namibia. Occasionally I do some other tech-related [workshops/talks](/talks). Beside work, I cycle often, boulder a bit less and make a pizza dough.
